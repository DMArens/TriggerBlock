# TriggerBlock
Take control of your emotions.

TriggerBlock **empowers** the user to prepare themselves for graphic content that could be a reminder of past traumatic events. It flags images and videos that contain potentially upsetting material, using a user-defined set of rules for **complete customization**. 

The goal of TriggerBlock is **not to discourage exposure** to uncomfortable material; rather, TriggerBlock **enables the viewer to prepare themselves** for the upcoming content in order to maintain control over their emotions. Simply clicking on the blocked image or video will enable the viewer to experience the material when ready.

When it comes to our users, safety is the **top** priority. We will never automatically unflag an image, which we believe will help protect users of internet harassment as well as users suffering from PTSD.
